## Quiet Game Instructor Redux - The Last Stand Update ##
### Note ###
This mod has been reported to be not working, please refer to Issue #1 for details.

### What is this? ###
This addon is the continuation of Quiet Game Instructor made by Weaver. 

Since the mod author is still inactive even after The Last Stand update, so we decided to continue updating their mod. This mod simply removes annoying Tips on Game Instructor, allowing you to focus on gameplay.

### Features ###
- Hide the annoying Tips such as "Use your Health kit", "Give Adrenaline to..."
- Actively updated

### Thanks to ###
- Weaver for making the Quiet Game Instructor mod
- Valve Corporation for making awesome games such as Left 4 Dead 2
- And you, for using our mods!
